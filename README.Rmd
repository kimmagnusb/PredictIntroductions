This is an iterative script which builds model and then creates forecasts for the introduction of regionally alien Norwegian fish species. 


Folder set-up
Work off the MainScript.R. It will create your data folders for you as you work through the various scripts. 
Scripts 1 and 2 create data which will be put into a general Data folder. After that, data becomes species specific and will
ve put into a species data folder.

The main script and all of the source scripts have fairly copious comments attached as of right now, but of course there's always room to elaborate,
so if there's a section of code you don't understand just let me know.
